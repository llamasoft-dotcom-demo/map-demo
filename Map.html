            In helping clients understand their supply chains,  maps are an important visualization tool.
            In this exercise we would like you to take some steps   to help make this map more useful.
            This example uses Google Maps and their maps API to     show information about airports. While 
            we do not use Google Maps and the maps API, the types   of visualizations and map interactions
            you are allowed with Google Maps are common. In order   to do this exercise you will need to get
            an API key for Google Maps if you do not already have   one. Put the API key in the appropriate place
            in this file.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Currently this page loads a list of airports into a     drop down. You can select an airport
            and it&quot;s code and city will display in the data    table. A marker will be placed on the
            map displaying the airport. If you roll your mouse  over the marker the airport&quot;s code
            will be displayed.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The current code is very simple. Many improvements  need to be made:
            <ul>
              <li>Fill in the rest of the data in the table when a  user selects an airport.</li>
              <li>Allow a user to remove a marker</li>
              <li>Sort the list so it is easier to find airports</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Some more things to think about
            <ul>
              <li>We are constantly struggling with displaying as   much data as simply and
              streamlined as possible. Is there something you can   do with the layout to show
              the same information using less screen real estate?</li>
              
              <li>Regarding markers, what happens with the  existing code when you select an item multiple times?</li>
              
              <li>If a user selects an airport that is not  currently shown on the map, how do they find it?
              Can you make this easier?</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
