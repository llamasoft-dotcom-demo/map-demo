                            In helping clients understand their supply chains, maps are an important visualization tool. In this exercise we would like
                            you to take some steps to help make this map more useful. This example uses Google Maps and their
                            maps API to show information about airports. While we do not use Google Maps and the maps API,
                            the types of visualizations and map interactions you are allowed with Google Maps are common.
                            In order to do this exercise you will need to get an API key for Google Maps if you do not already
                            have one. Put the API key in the appropriate place in this file.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Currently this page loads a list of airports into a drop down. You can select an airport and it&quot;s code and city will
                            display in the data table. A marker will be placed on the map displaying the airport. If you
                            roll your mouse over the marker the airport&quot;s code will be displayed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The current code is very simple. Many improvements need to be made:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fill in the rest of the data in the table when a user selects an airport.</li>
                                <li>Allow a user to remove a marker</li>
                                <li>Sort the list so it is easier to find airports</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some more things to think about
                            <ul>
                                <li>We are constantly struggling with displaying as much data as simply and streamlined as
                                    possible. Is there something you can do with the layout to show the same information
                                    using less screen real estate?</li>

                                <li>Regarding markers, what happens with the existing code when you select an item multiple
                                    times?</li>

                                <li>If a user selects an airport that is not currently shown on the map, how do they find it?
                                    Can you make this easier?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
