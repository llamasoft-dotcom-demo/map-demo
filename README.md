# map-demo
A sample project for prospects

# Updates

1. When the user selects value in the dropdown corresponding values are populated in the below area(Not just code and city)
2. Cleared the contents in the information box(area below the dropdown) if the selected value in the dropdown is null
3. Sorted the values in dropdown by airport code
4. The user can delete the marker upon single click on the marker
5. Changed the width and height of map to fit the page accordingly

# Observation

1. No matter how many times the user selects the airport code, a single marker appears
2. The user cannot select any other airports apart from those that are mentioned in the dropdown

# Fun part

1. Enjoyed playing with Google API
2. Got to learn few new things
