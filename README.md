# Updates made
* When selecting a marker on the map the complete airport information is shown (not just the Code and City)
* When selecting the marker you have the ability to delete it
* The airport list is now sorted by Code
* Made the map a tad smaller

# Code observations
* All of my changes were pretty much in javascript
* Enjoyed getting to work with the google map API

# Suggestions
* I could have spent more time styling the application, especially the info box when clicking on a marker.
* Could have also used a template for info box so that it is easier to build off of instead of inlining it in createMarker function.

# Going above and beyond
* Automatically pan to a newly added marker
* Clicking on a marker gives you an at a glance view of all the information (previous displayed underneath the map). This better takes advantage of the screen real-estate.
