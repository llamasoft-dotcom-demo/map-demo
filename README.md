# map-demo
A sample project for prospects

I took the liberty of adding a search box for the airport whch searches does a full text search on both the airport code and city.  
(I figured nearly 100 airports is a lot for a drop-down without a search) The search results are sorted.

In order to make the selected airport easy to find I center the map on the last one selected.

I changed the table to horzontal style to save space.  I could have styled it better to save even more space if necessary.

An airport can be removed by selecting it, and clicking the Remove button.  

If I had more time, I think I would allow markers to be removed by clicking on the actual marker.
