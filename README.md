#### Updates:
* Turned Airport list switch statement into a map control
* Added a map pan when marker is placed
* Left clicking the marker will bring up the Airport Information
* Right clicking the marker will remove the marker
* Made map a bit larger now that the static Airport Information isn't needed

#### Interesting things about the code:
* Using underscore to create the template for the select control and infowindow ended up being fun.
* Learning what I needed on Google maps API for this exercise and handling of the markers.

#### Suggestions for improvement:
* Maybe add some settings on whether panning to marker would be automatic, or display information when marker was placed.

#### Above and beyond:
* It was suggested in the HTML but I think making sure the data was all contained in the map looked really nice.
