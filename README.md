# map-demo - committed version from Mark Evans

Changes:

* Updated selected to contain City/State and sort by City. Also, airports added are disabled/enabled in select list
to prevent double-adding.
* Added list of airports on right side of browser with toggle show/hide.
  - airport div has info and controls to remove airport, center map on airport, and include in map view.
* Added infowindow (callout) to google map marker that opens when marker is clicked and closes if clicked again.
