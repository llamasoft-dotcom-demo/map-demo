                    Notice the route is working properly in the navbar. That is because react-router is used.
                    Thanks for your interest in my application. I look forward to being part of your team and beringing my skills to your company.

                        What about the google map?
                    </h4>
                    After trying several different react google map libraries only to realize they don't work properly, I finally used the react-google-maps package to display and wrap the google map, and then implemented most of the functionalities myself. Marker, layouts, and user interactions are all implemented by myself. That took me sometime, but I enjoyed it a lot.
